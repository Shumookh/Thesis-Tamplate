# Thesis Template
The zip file contains the thesis template for KKU 2024/2025. You can download the zip file and then run the main.tex file in a LaTeX environment such as TeXstudio, Overleaf, or TeXShop using the XeLaTeX compiler.

You can also use this template for general theses by changing the logo and following your institution’s guidelines.
